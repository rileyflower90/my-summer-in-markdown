# My Summer Recap
## Introduction
#### Hi, my name is Riley Park and I am a sophomore here at Chatsworth. Some of the things I enjoy doing is baking, playing pickleball with friends, and painting.
## Summer Activities
#### <ul>
  <li>I went to Spain for 2 weeks with my family. I really enjoyed the different culture they had there, and it was a fun little vacation we had before school started.</li>
  <li>During summer break, I went to Disneyland with my 3 of my cousins. They live 10 minutes away from the park, so I slept over at my cousin's house and went the next morning. We had a blast there and I loved riding all the roller coasters.</li>
</ul>

## Favorite Book or Movie
#### Over summer break, my favorite movie that I watched was Midsommar. This movie was about a couple who went to Sweden with some of their college friends, and joined a cult. I watched this movie with some of my friends, and enjoyed it because of how interesting the storyline was.


## Favorite Summer Food
#### During summer break, the one thing that I really enjoyed eating in Spain was paella. Paella is a Spanish dish that is made of rice and a type of seafood. I really enjoyed eating this because it is similar to Korean food, which I really like.

## Sports or Physical Activites
#### Over the summer, I played pickleball with my friends in Simi Valley. If you don't know already, pickleball is sport that uses a paddle and a ball, which is similar to tennis. I played this almost everyday at night, and had a blast battling other people.
